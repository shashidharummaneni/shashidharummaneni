> "You don’t set out to build a wall. You don’t start by saying, ‘I’m going to build the biggest, baddest wall that’s ever been built.’
   You don’t start there. You say, ‘I’m going to lay this brick as perfectly as a brick can be laid.’
   If you do that every single day, soon you will have a wall." — Will Smith​
